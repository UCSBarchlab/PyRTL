    :return: a map of the form {src_wire: {dst_wire: [path]}} for each src_wire in src

        where path is a list of nets. This map is also an instance of PathsResult,
        so you can call `print()` on it to pretty print it.

    You can provide dst_nets (the result of calling pyrtl.net_connections()), if you plan
    on calling this function repeatedly on a block that hasn't changed, to speed things up.

    This function can accept one or more src wires, and one or more dst wires,
    such that it returns a map that can be accessed like so:

        paths[src][dst] = [<path>, <path>, ...]

    where <path> is a list of nets. Thus there can be multiple paths from a given src wire
    to a given dst wire.

    If src and dst are both single wires, you still need to access the result via paths[src][dst].

    This also finds and returns the loop paths in the case of registers or memories that feed into
    themselves, i.e. paths[src][src] is not necessarily empty.

    It does not distinguish between loops that include synchronous vs asynchronous memories.
