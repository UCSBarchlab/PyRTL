class Block(object):
    """ Block encapsulates a netlist.

    A Block in PyRTL is the class that stores a netlist and provides basic access
    and error checking members.  Each block has well defined inputs and outputs,
    and contains both the basic logic elements and references to the wires and
    memories that connect them together.

    The logic structure is primarily contained in self.logic which holds a set of
    "LogicNet"s. Each LogicNet describes a primitive operation (such as an adder
    or memory).  The primitive is described by a 4-tuple of:

    1) the op (a single character describing the operation such as '+' or 'r'),
    2) a set of hard parameters to that primitives (such as the constants to
       select from the "selection" op.
    3) the tuple "args" which list the wirevectors hooked up as inputs to
       this particular net.
    4) the tuple "dests" which list the wirevectors hooked up as output for
       this particular net.

    Below is a list of the basic operations.  These properties (more formally
    specified) should all be checked by the class method sanity_check.

    * Most logical and arithmetic ops are pretty self explanatory, each takes
      exactly two arguments and they should perform the arithmetic or logical
      operation specified. OPS: ('&','|','^','n','+','-','*').  All inputs must
      be the same bitwidth.  Logical operations produce as many bits as are in
      the input, while '+' and '-' produce n+1 bits, and '*' produced 2n bits.

    * In addition there are some operations for performing comparisons
      that should perform the operation specified.  The '=' op is checking
      to see if the bits of the vectors are equal, while '<' and '>' do
      unsigned arithmetic comparison.  All comparisons generate a single bit
      of output (1 for true, 0 for false).

    * The 'w' operator is simply a directional wire and has no logic function.

    * The 'x' operator is a mux which takes a select bit and two signals.
      If the value of the select bit is 0 it selects the second argument, if
      it is 1 it selects the third argument.  Select must be a single bit, while
      the other two arguments must be the same length.

    * The 'c' operator is the concatiation operator and combines any number of
      wirevectors (a,b,...,z) into a single new wirevector with "a" in the MSB
      and "z" (or whatever is last) in the LSB position.

    * The 's' operator is the selection operator and chooses, based in the
      op_param specificied, a subset of the logic bits from a wire vector to
      select.  Repeats are accepted.

    * The 'r' operator is a register and on posedge, simply copies the value
      from the input to the output of the register

    * The 'm' operator is a memory block read port, which supports async reads (acting
      like combonational logic). Multiple read (and write) ports are possible to
      the same memory but each 'm' defines only one of those. The op_param
      is a tuple containing two references: the mem id, and a reference to the
      MemBlock containing this port. The MemBlock should only be used for debug and
      sanity checks. Each read port has one addr (an arg) and one data (a dest).

    * The '@' (update) operator is a memory block write port, which supports syncronous writes
      (writes are "latched" at posedge).  Multiple write (and read) ports are possible
      to the same memory but each '@' defines only one of those. The op_param
      is a tuple containing two references: the mem id, and a reference to the MemoryBlock.
      Writes have three args (addr, data, and write enable).  The dests should be an
      empty tuple.  You will not see a written value change until the following cycle.
      If multiple writes happen to the same address in the same cycle the behavior is currently
      undefined.

    The connecting elements (args and dests) should be WireVectors or derived
    from WireVector, and should be registered with the block using
    the method add_wirevector.  Nets should be registered using add_net.

    In addition, there is a member legal_ops which defines the set of operations
    that can be legally added to the block.  By default it is set to all of the above
    defined operations, but it can be useful in certain cases to only allow a
    subset of operations (such as when transforms are being done that are "lowering"
    the blocks to more primitive ops.
