<p>PyRTL provides a collection of classes for pythonic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register-transfer_level">register-transfer level</a> design, simulation, tracing, and testing 
suitable for teaching and research. Simplicity, usability, clarity, and extensibility rather than
performance or optimization is the overarching goal.  Features include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Elaboration-through-execution, meaning all of Python can be used including introspection</li>
<li>Design, instantiate, and simulate all in one file and without leaving Python</li>
<li>Export to, or import from, common HDLs (BLIF-in, Verilog-out currently supported)</li>
<li>Examine execution with waveforms on the terminal or export to a .vcd as projects scale</li>
<li>Elaboration, synthesis, and basic optimizations all included</li>
<li>Small and well-defined internal core structure means writing new transforms is easier</li>
<li>Batteries included means many useful components are already available and more are coming every week</li>
</ul>

<p>At a high level PyRTL builds the hardware structure that you <em>explicitly define</em>.  If you are looking for a 
tool to take your random python code and turn it into hardware, you will have to look elsewhere 
-- this is <b>not</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_synthesis">HLS</a>.
Instead PyRTL is designed to help you concisely and precisely describe a digitial hardware structure (that you already have 
worked out in detail) in python.  PyRTL restricts you to a set of resonable digital designs practices -- the clock and resets
are implicit, block memories are synchronous by default, there are no "undriven" states, and no weird un-registered feedbacks are
allowed.  Instead, of worrying about these "analog-ish" tricks that are horrible ideas in modern processes anyways, PyRTL let's
you treat hardware design like a software problem -- build recursive hardware, write instrospective containers,
and have fun building digital designs again!</p>

<p>To the user it provides a set of python classes that allow you to express their 
hardware designs reasonably pythonically.  For example, with WireVector you get a structure that acts very 
much like a python list of 1-bit wires, so that <code>mywire[0:-1]</code> selects everything except the 
most-significant-bit.  Of course you can add, subtract, and multiply these WireVectors or concat multiple
bit-vectors end-to-end as well.  You can then even make normal python collections of those WireVectors and 
do operations on them in bulk. For example, if you have a list of <em>n</em> different k-bit WireVectors (called "x") and you 
want to multiply each of them by 2 and put the sum of the result in a WireVector "y", it looks like
the following:  <code>y = sum([elem * 2 for elem in x])</code>. 
Hardware comprehensions are surprisingly useful.</p>

<p>While adders are a builtin primitive for PyRTL, most people doing RTL are familiar with the idea of a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)">Ripple-Carry Adder</a> and so it is useful to see how you 
might express one in PyRTL if you had to.  Rather than the typical <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL3ihMA8_Gs">Verilog introduction to fixed 4-bit 
adders</a>, let's go ahead and build an <em>arbitrary</em> bitwidth 
adder.</p>

<p>The code above includes an adder generator with python-style slices on wires (ripple_add), an instantiation 
of a register (used as a counter with the generated adder), and all the code needed to simulate the design, 
generate a waveform, and render it to the terminal. The way this particular code works is described more in 
the examples directory.  When you run it, it should look like this (you can see the counter going from 0 to 7 and repeating):</p>

<a id="a-few-gotchas" class="anchor" href="#a-few-gotchas" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A Few Gotchas</h3>

<p>While python is an amazing language, DSLs in python are always forced to make a few compromises which can sometime catch
users in some unexpected ways.  Watch out for these couple of "somewhat surprising features"</p>

<ul>
<li><p>PyRTL never uses any of the "in-place arithmetic assignments" such as <code>+=</code> or <code>&amp;=</code> in the traditional ways.
Instead only <code>&lt;&lt;=</code> and <code>|=</code> are defined and they are used for wire-assignment and conditional-wire-assignment
respectively (more on both of these in the examples).   If you declare a <code>x = WireVector(bitwidth=3)</code> and 
<code>y = WireVector(bitwidth=5)</code>, how do you assign <code>x</code> the value of <code>y + 1</code>?  If you do <code>x = y + 1</code> 
that will replace the old definition of <code>x</code> entirely?  Instead you need to write <code>x &lt;&lt;= y + 1</code> which you 
can read as "x gets its value from y + 1".</p></li>
<li><p>The example above also shows off another aspect of PyRTL.  The bitwidth of <code>y</code> is 5.  The bitwidth of <code>y + 1</code>
is actually 6 (PyRTL infers this automatically).  But then when you assign <code>x &lt;&lt;= y + 1</code> you are taking
a 6-bit value and assigning it to 3-bit value.  This is completely legal and only the least significant bits 
will be assigned.  Mind your bitwidths.</p></li>
<li><p>PyRTL provides some handy functions on WireVectors, including <code>==</code> and <code>&lt;</code> which evaluate to a new WireVector
a single bit long to hold the result of the comparison.  The bitwise operators <code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>~</code> and <code>^</code>
are also defined (however logic operations such as "and" and "not" are not).  A really tricky gotcha happens
when you start combining the two together.  Consider: <code>doit = ready &amp; state==3</code>.  In python, the bitwise
<code>&amp;</code> operator has <em>higher precedence</em> than <code>==</code>, thus python parses this as <code>doit = (ready &amp; state)==3</code>
instead of what you might have guessed at first!  Make sure to use parenthesis when using comparisons with
logic operations to be clear: <code>doit = ready &amp; (state==3)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>PyRTL right now assumes that all WireVectors are unsigned integers.  When you do comparisons
such as "&lt;" it will do unsigned comparison.  If you pass a WireVector to a function that requires more bits 
that you have provided, it will do zero extension by default.  You can always explicitly do sign extension
with .sign_extend() but it is not the default behavior for WireVector.  This is right now for clarity and
consistency, although it does make writing signed arithmetic operations more text heavy.</p></li>
</ul>

<a id="related-projects" class="anchor" href="#related-projects" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Related Projects</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.myhdl.org/">MyHDL</a> is a neat Python hardware project built around generators and decorators.  The semantics of this embedded language
are close to Verilog and unlike PyRTL, MyHDL allows asynchronous logic and higher level modeling.  Much like Verilog, only a structural
"convertible subset" of the language can be automatically synthesized into real hardware.  PyRTL requires all logic to be both synchronous
and synthesizable which avoids a common trap for beginners, it elaborates the design during execution allowing the full power of python
in describing recursive or complex hardware structures, and allows for hardware synthesis, simulation, test bench creation, and optimization
all in the same framework.</p>

<p><a href="https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Chisel</a> is a project with similar goals to PyRTL but is based instead in Scala.  Scala
provides some very helpful embedded language features and a rich type system. Chisel is (like PyRTL) a elaborate-through-execution hardware design language.  With support
for signed types, named hierarchies of wires useful for hardware protocols, and a neat control structure call "when" that inspired our
conditional contexts, Chisel is a powerful tool used in some great research projects including OpenRISC.  Unlike Chisel, PyRTL has
concentrated on a complete tool chain which is useful for instructional projects, and provides a clearly defined and relatively easy to
manipulate intermediate structure in the class Block (often times call pyrtl.core) which allows rapid prototyping of hardware analysis
routines which can then be codesigned with the architecture.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.clifford.at/yosys/">Yosys</a> is an open source tool for Verilog RTL synthesis. It supports a huge subset of the Verilog-2005
semantics and provides a basic set of synthesis algorithms.  The goals of this this tool are quite different from PyRTL, but the two
play very nicely together in that PyRTL can output Verilog that can then be synthesized through Yosys.  Likewise Yosys can take
Verilog designs and synthesize them to a very simple library of gates and output them as a "blif" file which can then be read in by
PyRTL.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cornell-brg/pymtl">PyMTL</a> is an alpha stage "open-source Python-based framework for multi-level hardware modeling".
One of the neat things about this project is that they are trying to allow simulation and modeling at multiple different levels of the
design from the functional level, the cycle-close level, and down to the register-transfer level (where PyRTL really is built to play).
Like MyHDL they do some meta-programming tricks like parsing the Python AST to allow executable software descriptions to be (under
certain restrictions -- sort of like verilog) automatically converted into implementable hardware.  PyRTL, on the other hand, is about
providing a limited and composable set of data structures to be used to specify an RTL implementation, thus avoiding the distinction between
synthesizable and non-synthesizable code (the execution is the elaboration step).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.clash-lang.org/">CλaSH</a> is a hardware description embedded DSL in Haskell. Like PyRTL it provides an
approach suitable for both combinational and synchronous sequential circuits and allows the transform
of these high-level descriptions to low-level synthesizable Verilog HDL.  Unlike PyRTL, designs are statically
typed (like VHDL), yet with a very high degree of type inference, enabling both safe and fast prototying using concise
descriptions.  If you like functional programing and hardware I would also checkout out
