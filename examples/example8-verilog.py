""" Example 8:  Interfacing with Verilog.

    While there is much more about PyRTL design to discuss, at some point somebody
    might ask you to do something with your code other than have it print
    pretty things out to the terminal.  We provide import from and export to
    Verilog of designs, export of waveforms to VCD, and a set of transforms
    that make doing netlist-level transforms and analyis directly in pyrtl easy.

# ---- Importing From Verilog ----

# Sometimes it is useful to pull in components written in Verilog to be used
# as subcomponents of PyRTL designs or to be subject to analysis written over
# the PyRTL core.   One standard format supported by PyRTL is "blif" format:
# https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ee760/760docs/blif.pdf

# Many tools supoprt outputing hardware designs to this format, including the
# free open source project "Yosys".   Blif files can then be imported either
# as a string or directly from a file name by the function input_from_blif.
# Here is a simple example of a 1 bit full adder imported and then simulated
# from this blif format.

# ---- Exporting to Verilog ----

# However, not only do we want to have a method to import from Verilog, we also
# want a way to export it back out to Verilog as well. To demonstrate PyRTL's
# ability to export in Verilog, we will create a sample 3-bit counter. However
# unlike the example in example2, we extend it to be synchronously resetting.

# here we are making use of that native add operation.  Let's dump this bad boy out
# to a verilog file and see what is looks like (here we are using StringIO just to
# print it to a string for demo purposes, most likely you will want to pass a normal
# open file).

# basic optimizations like constant propgation and dead wire elimination as well.  By
