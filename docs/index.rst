=====
PYRTL
=====

A collection of classes providing simple RTL specification, simulation, tracing, and testing suitable for
teaching and research. Simplicity, usability, clarity, and extendibility rather than performance or
optimization is the overarching goal.  With PyRTL you can use the full power of Python to describe complex
synthesizable digital designs, simulate and test them, and export them to Verilog.

Quick links
===========
* Get an overview from the `PyRTL Project Webpage <http://ucsbarchlab.github.io/PyRTL/>`_
* Read through `Example PyRTL Code <https://github.com/UCSBarchlab/PyRTL/tree/development/examples>`_
* File a `Bug or Issue Report <https://github.com/UCSBarchlab/PyRTL/issues>`_
* Contribute to project on `GitHub <https://github.com/UCSBarchlab/PyRTL>`_

Installation
============

**Automatic installation**::

    pip install pyrtl

PyRTL is listed in `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyrtl>`_ and
can be installed with :program:`pip` or :program:`pip3`.  If the above
command fails due to insufficient permissions, you may need to do
``sudo pip install pyrtl`` (to install as superuser) or ``pip install --user pyrtl``
(to install as a normal user).

PyRTL is tested to work with Python 3.8+.



Design, Simulate, and Inspect in 15 lines
=========================================

.. code-block::
    :linenos:

    import pyrtl

    a = pyrtl.Input(8,'a')  # input "pins"
    b = pyrtl.Input(8,'b')
    q = pyrtl.Output(8,'q')  # output "pins"
    gt5 = pyrtl.Output(1,'gt5')

    result = a + b  # makes an 8-bit adder
    q <<= result  # assigns output of adder to out pin
    gt5 <<= result > 5  # does a comparison, assigns that to different pin

    # simulate and output the resulting waveform to the terminal
    sim = pyrtl.Simulation()
    sim.step_multiple({'a':[0,1,2,3,4], 'b':[2,2,3,3,4]})
    sim.tracer.render_trace()

After you have PyRTL installed, you should be able to cut and paste the above into a file and run it with
Python.  The result you should see, drawn right into the terminal, is the output of the simulation.  While a
great deal of work has gone into making hardware design in PyRTL as friendly a process as possible, please
don't mistake that for a lack of depth.  You can just as easily export to Verilog or other hardware formats,
view results with your favorite waveform viewer, build hardware transformation passes, run JIT-accelerated
simulations, design, test, and even verify hugely complex digital systems, and much more.  Most critically of
all it is easy to extend with your own approaches to digital hardware development as you find necessary.


Overview of PyRTL
=================

If you are brand new to PyRTL we recommend that you start with going through the
`Examples of PyRTL Code <https://github.com/UCSBarchlab/PyRTL/tree/development/examples>`_ which will show you
most of the core functionality in the context of a complete design.

PyRTL Classes:
--------------

Perhaps the most important class to understand is :class:`.WireVector`, which is the basic type from which you build
all hardware.  If you are coming to PyRTL from Verilog, a :class:`.WireVector` is closest to a multi-bit `wire`.
Every new :class:`.WireVector` builds a set of wires which you can then connect with other :class:`.WireVector` through
overloaded operations such as `addition` or `bitwise or`. A bunch of other related classes, including
:class:`.Input`, :class:`.Output`, :class:`.Const`, and :class:`.Register` are all derived from :class:`.WireVector`. Coupled with
:class:`.MemBlock` (and :class:`.RomBlock`), this is all a user needs to create a functional hardware design.

.. inheritance-diagram:: pyrtl.wire.WireVector
                         pyrtl.wire.Input
                         pyrtl.wire.Output
                         pyrtl.wire.Const
                         pyrtl.wire.Register

After specifying a hardware design, there are then options to simulate your design right in PyRTL,
synthesize it down to primitive 1-bit operations, optimize it, and export it to Verilog (along with
a testbench),.

To simulate your hardware design one needs to do a simulation, and to view the output we need to capture a
"trace".  Simulation is how your hardware is "executed" for the purposes of testing, and three different
classes help you do that: :class:`.Simulation`, :class:`.FastSimulation` and :class:`.CompiledSimulation`.  All three have
`almost` the same interface and, except for a few debugging cases, can be used interchangeably.  Typically one
starts with :class:`.Simulation` and then moves up to :class:`.FastSimulation` when performance begins to matter.

Both :class:`.Simulation` and :class:`.FastSimulation` take an instance of :class:`.SimulationTrace` as an argument (or make a new
blank one by default), which stores a list of the signals as they are simulated.  This trace can then be
rendered to the terminal with :class:`.WaveRenderer`, although unless there are some problems with the
default configurations, most end users should not need to even be aware of :class:`.WaveRenderer`.  The
examples describe other ways that the trace may be handled, including extraction as a test bench and export to
a VCD file.

* :class:`.FastSimulation`
* :class:`.CompiledSimulation`
* :class:`.SimulationTrace`
* :class:`.WaveRenderer`

When you are building hardware with the :class:`.WireVector` and :class:`.MemBlock` classes, what is really happening
under the hood is that those classes are just "sugar" over a core set of primitives and a data structure
keeps incrementally updating a graph of those primitives which, when complete, represent the final design.
:class:`WireVectors<.WireVector>` connect to "primitives" which connect to other :class:`WireVectors<.WireVector>` and the class that stores
a primitive is :class:`.LogicNet`.  The class :class:`.Block` is then a wrapper for a set of these :class:`LogicNets<.LogicNet>`.  Typically
a full and complete design is stored in a single :class:`.Block`.  The function :func:`.working_block()` will return
back the block on which we are implicitly working.  When we write hardware transforms we may wish to make a new
:class:`.Block` from an old one and augment the information kept with my hardware block and :class:`.PostSynthBlock` is
one example of this pattern in action.

* :class:`.LogicNet`

Finally, when things go wrong you may hit on one of two ``Exceptions``, neither of which is likely recoverable
automatically (which is why we limited them to only two).  The intention is that ``PyrtlError`` is intended
to capture end user errors such as invalid constant strings and mis-matched bitwidths.  In contrast,
``PyrtlInternalError`` captures internal invariants and assertions over the core logic graph which should never
be hit when constructing designs in the normal ways.  If you hit a confusing ``PyrtlError`` or any
``PyrtlInternalError`` feel free to file an issue.
