This says to perform the following code 'n' times, but the value 'n' is passed as an input and is not something that is evaluated in the hardware, it is evaluated when you run the PyRTL program which generates (or more specifically elaborates) the hardware. Thus the hardware we are building will have The value of 'n' built into the hardware and won't actually be a run-time parameter. Loops are really useful for building large repetitive hardware structures, but they CAN'T be used to represent hardware that should do a computation iteratively. Instead we are going to need to use some registers to build a state machine.\n",

Thus ```(b, a + b)``` in the first iteration is: ```( Const(1), result_of_adding( Const(0), Const(1) )``` At the end of the first iteration **```a```** and **```b```** refer to those two constant values. In each following iteration more adders are built and the names **```a```** and **```b```** are bound to larger and larger trees of adders but all the inputs are constants!\n",
